## Future Work
To further enhance the functionality and user experience of our weather site, there are more additions that can be developed.

2. **Search History and Favorites:**
   - Develop features that allow users to save their searches and favorite images. This would enable quick access to previously viewed weather and city images, making the site more user-centric.

3. **Image Saving Options:**
   - Introduce the ability for users to save the images displayed based on the weather conditions. This could include options to download images or save them to a personal gallery within their account.

4. **Enhanced Search Capabilities:**
   - Expand the search functionality to include more specific parameters, such as searching by temperature range, time of day, or specific weather conditions, providing a more tailored user experience.

5. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Optimize the website for mobile devices, ensuring that users can access our service on-the-go with the same ease and functionality as on desktop platforms.
